## Project 1: ETL with PostgreSQL
A startup called Sparkify wants to analyze the data they've been collecting on songs and user activity on their new music streaming app. The analytics team is particularly interested in understanding what songs users are listening to. We need to create a Postgres database with tables designed to optimize queries on song play analysis, and bring you on the project. The role is to create a database schema and ETL pipeline for this analysis.

In this project, I will apply data modeling with Postgres and build an ETL pipeline using Python. To complete the project, I will define fact and dimension tables for a star schema for a particular analytic focus, and write an ETL pipeline that transfers data from files in two local directories into these tables in Postgres using Python and SQL.
